		<h1>Assignment 1</h1>

		<h2>Personal Information</h2>

		<p>My name is Kristofer Hess. I am fine if I am called either Kristofer
			or Kris, I dont really have a preference.</p>

		<p>My OSU email address is HESSKR@OREGONSTATE.EDU</p>

		<p>I am in the process of changing my major from ECE proschool to CS.
			I am also a part-time student so while this is my 6th year of
			school It is more like my 4th if I had been able to remain a
			full-time student.</p>

		<p>On a scale of 0-10 on how much html I have seen before I am a 0. I
			have done a fair amount of coding in c, c++, python, and
			assembly, but I have never encountered html.</p>

		<p>I hope to learn how to create and manage my own website. I am looking
			to be able to run a website as a part of my resume that has
			links to my previous large assignments and home projects to
			use as examples of what I know and how i work.</p>

		<p>I have signed up for Piazza. The answers to some questions I had were
			very helpful.</p>

		<p>I have been playing the saxophone for 12 years. I have performed in
			school concerts, statewide competitions, marching bands, jazz
			bands, and wind ensembles. Some performances were small, for
			judges only, and some were for 40,000 people with fireworks
			and screaming fans. Music has been a huge part of my life.</p>
